# Autocorrect

I decided to make a sort of homemade autocorrect. The only advantage this has over traditional autocorrect is that it will create an alert and allow you to choose between two versions before substituting its own matches.

This uses the Levenshtein Distance algorithm, which is commonly used in spell checkers and DNA sequencing.
